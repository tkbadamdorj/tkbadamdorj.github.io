I successfully defended my Masters thesis at the University of Alberta! 

In my thesis I focused on video highlight detection where the aim is to train a neural network to automatically find the most interesting moments in videos. I explored two different aspects of the task. Firstly, I investigated how we can use what we hear in the video to improve our performance since the vast majority of works only make use of visual cues in the video. Secondly, I presented a new way to perform this task without needing humans to manually label highlights to train our network.
