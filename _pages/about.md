My core interests are: 

- finding problems
- solving them

I'm a Machine Learning Research Engineer at [RBC Borealis](https://rbcborealis.com/) serving as tech lead on [ATOM - a foundation model for financial services](https://rbcborealis.com/applications/atom/).

I obtained my Master of Science degree in Computer Vision and Machine Learning from the University of Alberta where I was advised by [Prof. Li Cheng](https://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~lcheng5/). I have publications at top conferences such as [CVPR](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Badamdorj_Contrastive_Learning_for_Unsupervised_Video_Highlight_Detection_CVPR_2022_paper.html), [ICCV](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Badamdorj_Joint_Visual_and_Audio_Learning_for_Video_Highlight_Detection_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf) and [EMNLP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12126.pdf).

Two of the tools that I worked on during my undergrad are being used in a practical setting (Dead Sea Scrolls [[1]](/assets/pdf/MatchingDeadSeaScrolls.pdf), [[2]](https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive), Wiener Library [[1]](https://wienerholocaustlibrary.org/), [[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07899.pdf)). 

Outside of work I enjoy doing improv comedy, lifting heavy weights, and supporting the [Edmonton Oilers](https://www.nhl.com/oilers/schedule).
